# RFM Analysis
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests and spending habits.

3. It can improve customer service
   
In this project, I will go through step by step how to conduct RFM Analysis in order to segment our customers.
